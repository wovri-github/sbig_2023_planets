A "So Bad It's Good 2023" Game Jam Entry!

Pick-me-pretty-please is determined to get his spot in the Solar Calendar Unibrow Universe! 
Control Scheme

WASD to move, LMB to select, and Space/Enter for Dialogues.
Why is it "So Bad It's Good"?

    We wrote up a pretty gag-filled script
    The art was styled to have both good and poor design & color choices
    We chose to mess around with the style and tone of our sfx/VO
    We hope that you find the gameplay funky!

Modifier Relevance

All Suggestions given to the player, must be combined at the end of it.
